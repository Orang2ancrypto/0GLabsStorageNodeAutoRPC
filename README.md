# 0GLabsStorageNodeAutoRPC
It is as the name suggest, this helps change the RPC automatically with a timer

I'm still a novice when it comes to programming, any help or suggestion are welcome,
if you're clueless on how to run this on your linux CLI, don't worry i'll help.

1. Make sure you have python 3.12 or the latest installed in your system
2. Create a python virtual environment in your directory with "python -m venv venv"
3. Activate the python virtual environment with "source venv/bin/activate"
4. Install these two libraries,
5.1. "pip install playwright" then "playwright install",
5.2. "pip install rich",
6. then run the python program using "python3 <YOUR_FILE_NAME>.py"

If you wish to change the timer you can change it in the file, it is located at the very top
or if you decide that you don't want the timer you can choose without the timer one from the repo.

You are all set! Have fun!!!
